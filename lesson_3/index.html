						Ukraine gained <span class="yellow">independence</span> after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991
						and has since veered between seeking closer integration with Western Europe
						and being drawn into the orbit of Russia, which sees its interests as
						threatened by a Western-leaning Ukraine.
					</p>
					<div class="text">
						<p>Europe's second largest country, Ukraine is a land of wide, fertile
							agricultural plains, with large pockets of heavy industry in the east.<p>
						<p>While Ukraine and Russia share common historical origins, the west of
							the country has closer ties with its European neighbours, particularly
							Poland, and nationalist sentiment has been strongest there.
						</p>
						<p>A significant minority of the population uses Russian as its first
							language, particularly in the cities and the industrialised east.</p>
						<p>An uprising against pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014
							ushered in a series of Western-leaning governments.</p>
						<p>But Russia used the opportunity to seize the Crimean peninsula and arm
							insurgent groups to occupy parts of the east, eventually launching a
							full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

						<p>Mr Zelensky's initial claim to fame was playing a fictional president
							in a television comedy programme, and his victorious election campaign
							echoed his character's anti-establishment stance.
						</p>
						<p>His Servant of the People party went on to win early parliamentary
							elections in July 2019, giving him control of both the executive and the
							legislature.</p>
						<p>In his inaugural address, President Zelensky said ending the Moscow-run
							insurgency in the east would be his priority, and he went on to rally
							Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion in 2022.</p>
						<p>After the start of the invasion, he declared martial law across Ukraine
							and a general mobilisation of the armed forces. His leadership during the
							crisis has won him widespread international praise, and he has been
							described as a symbol of the <span class="green">Ukrainian resistance</span></p>

					<h3 class="bold">Russia's invasion has left a major footprint on Ukraine's diverse media scene.</h3>
					<div class="block">
						<p>The leading outlets, which used to present a diversity of views, adopted a unanimously defiant and patriotic approach to their war reporting.</p>
						<p>The top TV channels - including the public broadcaster and several major commercial stations - launched a pooled round-the-clock news service, which sought to foster national unity and rally Ukrainians around the war effort.</p>
						<p>Ukrainians have changed their media consumption since the start of the full-scale war, with social media replacing TV as a top news source for Ukrainians, new TV channels continuing to launch despite the conflict, and the complete loss of popularity of Russian outlets.</p>
						<p>In the year before the war, the government took further measures to curb pro-Russian narratives, including the closing of three news channels linked to a key pro-Moscow figure.</p>
						<p>Annexed Crimea and rebel-held territories in Donbas are under near-total Russian media influence.</p>
						<p>In peacetime, Ukraine generally enjoyed a much freer media environment than its closest post-Soviet neighbours but challenges were abundant - from disinformation on social media to lack of accountability for violence against journalists.</p>
						<p>The most popular TV channels were under the control of tycoons, while independent media generally relied on grants and donations.</p>
						<p>There were 41 million internet users by July 2022, 94% of the population <a target="_blank" href="https://www.internetworldstats.com">(Internetworldstats.com)</a>.</p>
